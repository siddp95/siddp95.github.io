# Siddarth Puliyanda Portfolio
Welcome to my personal Github portfolio! As a Data Science enthusiast with a focus on sports and online gaming, I have developed a range of programming projects that demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and passion in this field.

This portfolio contains three of my programming project highlights, showcasing my ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data to extract insights and solve real-world problems.

# [Project 1: 2023 NFL Touchdown Regression](https://github.com/siddp95/Fantasy-Football-2023/blob/main/2023%20TD%20Regression.ipynb)
* Collected, cleaned, and analyzed 2022 NFL stats to determine the whether a player scored more or less touchdowns than expected during the season
* Recalculated the amount of fantasy points a player would have scored in 2022 based on the predicted amount of touchdowns
* Created residual plots that displayed the names of players who had the most and least amount of difference between predicted vs. actual 
* Hypothesized how this information can be used to predict the amount of touchdowns scored by a player in the 2023 season
* Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
